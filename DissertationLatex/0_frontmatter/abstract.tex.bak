A hyperspectral unmixing algorithm that finds multiple sets of endmembers is introduced. The algorithm, called Context Dependent Spectral Unmixing (CDSU), is a local approach that adapts the unmixing to different regions of the spectral space.
\\It is based on a novel objective function that combines context identification and unmixing into a joint function. This objective function models contexts as compact clusters and uses the linear mixing model as the basis for unmixing. %The unmixing provides optimal endmembers and abundances for each context.
\\Different variations of the algorithm are also proposed. The Context Dependent Spectral unmixing using Gustafson Kessel clustering (GK-CDSU) accounts for non-spherical clusters. The Graph Constrained Multi-Model Unmixing (GC-MMU) algorithm uses partial supervision information to guide the search process and narrow the space of possible solutions. The Robust Context Dependent Spectral Unmixing (RCDSU) accounts for noise and outliers in the data. Finally, the Unsupervised Robust Context Dependent Spectral Unmixing (U-RCDSU) algorithm automatically finds the number of contexts.
\\An alternating optimization algorithm is derived for each algorithm. The performance is evaluated using synthetic and real data. We show that the proposed methods can identify meaningful and coherent contexts, and appropriate endmembers within each context.
\\Additionnally, a new class of hyperspectral subpixel target detectors is built on top of the context dependent spectral unmixing framework. The approach extends target detection methods to multiple contexts resulting in a better detection performance.
