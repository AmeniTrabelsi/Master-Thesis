\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
The discovery of semiconductors marked a key milestone for the digital age. They cover a wide range of applications and they are, most prominently, considered as the building blocks of modern electronics \cite{1}.  They are used for computers’ and high speed chips manufacturing, space research, medical science, energy efficient lighting and solar energy production.  Each particular application requires the identification and production of the semiconducting materials having the most suitable properties. The high pace of nowadays industrial evolution is creating an urgent need to design new cost efficient materials that can satisfy both current and future demands. However, time has always been the main constraint to achieve this goal. It has become almost intolerable to waste it synthetizing and testing thousands of new materials candidates while only few of them are actually needed. Even though this exhaustive experimental process has contributed to the discovery of several new materials, it still depends on chance and luck to succeed as fast as possible. This reflects a general oddity of materials design which “still depends on serendipity” \cite{2,3}.
\\
\indent The classical approach to overcome this problem was to use first principle ab initio methods for predicting electronic properties. For instance, computational quantum mechanical modeling techniques, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have been widely used for this purpose. DFT provides the ground state characteristics of a given compound by modeling every interacting system of intrinsic fermions via its density and not via its many-body wave function \cite{4,5}. It can predict a great variety of molecular properties: vibrational frequencies, molecular structures, atomization and ionization energies, electric and magnetic properties, reaction paths, etc. \cite{6}.
\\  
Due to the intricate nature of the relationships between particles such methods are computationally expensive which makes a large scale investigation of interesting materials rather infeasible \cite{7}. Hence, the idea of applying machine learning techniques in the field has emerged.

\section{A new vision for Materials Innovation }
\\
\indent Materials properties can be seen as the result of the interactions between more than one factor, each with a different weight depending on the final target. This includes the atomic composition, the material’s morphology and microstructure, the physical state, and many other intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that can be related to the preparation conditions \cite{8}. This basic observation has triggered the idea of designing new tools that are able to model these interactions in a way that facilitate the prediction of the properties an eventual new compound. The created models should benefit from the already established theoretical background in order to adjust the search space and to limit the set of materials candidates when looking for a new discoveries. 
\\
\indent Materials design is, therefore, an interdisciplinary field that requires the collaboration between more than one research areas to get the best results within the least possible amount of time. The “Materials Genome Initiative” (MGI) launched by the US government since 2010 has emphasized this vision [9]. It is a multi-agency initiative rolled out to encourage the creation of shared resources and infrastructures to support national institutions in their effort to design and expedite the synthesis of new advanced materials both rapidly and cost-efficiently \cite{9,10,11}. As a result, combinatorial and high-throughput (CHT) experimentation \cite{8} in materials science has been acclaimed as a new scientifically-efficient approach to generate new knowledge \cite{8,10}.
\\
\indent Exploiting these unique opportunities established a new infrastructure for materials innovation. As illustrated in Figure \ref{concept}, this infrastructure is based on the inter-operability between three main procedures: Theory, Experiments and Computer simulations, each involving different areas of studies and expertise \cite{10}.

\section{Predictive analytics}
The interdisciplinary aspect of the new materials innovation infrastructure has been associated with the raise of data science as a major contributor. In fact, machine learning has proven to be a promising field through the past decades. It is a flexible area of study that, based on data analysis and patterns extraction, adequate models are learnt to describe the inherent structure and behavior of a given training set of observations. Such models, if judiciously validated, can predict the response of any future unlisted observation. 
\\
\indent Even though the integration of machine learning techniques for materials discovery purposes is still new,  it is beginning to show enormous promises \cite{12,13,14,15,16}.   Moreover, data-centric approaches can provide valuable insights into the fundamental rules and aspects underlying materials behavior which have been difficult to apprehend for decades \cite{12}. Both supervised and unsupervised algorithms could be applied to predict materials properties, depending on the availability of the training sets. However, due to data scarcity, and to the complexity of generating new measurements, supervised techniques are used more often. For instance, statistical learning, such as regression techniques are very popular in the field \cite{12,17}. 
\section{Motivations and contributions}
As we enter this MGI era \cite{9}, it has become crucial to quickly and accurately predict the properties of new materials that have yet to be synthesized. Applying machine learning techniques to develop an efficient computational tool for solving this specific problem is a new yet promising research area.
\\
\indent This thesis finds its roots within this context. Different regression algorithms combined with well adjusted pre-processing techniques will be applied and tested on two different applications. The two applications are conceived in order to predict two key properties of semiconductors for different types of applications as described below.
\\
\indent The first application is based on a previous work aiming to predict the bandgap of new chalcopyrite compounds using statistical learning approaches such as Ordinary Least Squares, Partial Least Squares and Lasso regression methods coupled with Principal Component Analysis \cite{19}. The used data set comprises atomic and crystallographic properties of ternary chalcopyrites semiconductors which are CuFeS2-like compounds that crystallizes in the tetragonal system (ABC2 formula) \cite{18}. The band-gap is, in fact, a key property for solar cell materials design. It refers to the energy gap (in eV) between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band in semiconductors and insulators \cite{20}. 

Our replication and analysis of the previous results indicated that the predictor's performances can be enhanced. Our contribution herein is based mainly on features analysis. In fact, Band-gap engineering is a delicate task and obtaining an accurate and reliable prediction of totally new compounds requires a robust modeling that has to take into account not only the intrinsic characteristics of the included elements but also the interactions between them. This work will explore this possibility by predicting the band-gap of the same compounds after adding the duly chosen binary descriptors.
\\
\indent  The second application is designed to model the physical properties of Dilute Magnetic Semiconductors (DMS). These are materials that exhibit both ferromagnetic and semiconductor properties. These materials are widely studied within the newly emerged field known as Spintronics (Spin Transport Electronics)\cite{21,22,23}. If implemented within electronic devices, these materials offer the exciting prospect of combining classical semiconductor electronics with non volatile magnetic storage by providing a new type of conduction control. The intrinsic electronic spin as well as its associated magnetic moment are the key features to assess the level of applicability of a given new DMS compound \cite{22}. This work will focus on the analysis and modeling of the magnetic properties that DMS materials exhibit upon co-doping with extrinsic defects at room temperature. For different sets of hosts, Feature selection and regression algorithms  will be investigated in order to predict the total magnetic moment resulting from the co-doping process. Features' analysis will be emphasized during this process in order to unveil the synergistic action of the different descriptors.   
\\
\indent The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 2 provides a review of the existing methods used for band gap engineering and DMS materials design, as well as the application of machine learning techniques for knowledge discovery. Chapter 3 introduces our proposed learning approach. Chapter 4 provides experimental results and analysis of the proposed methods. Finally, chapter 5 provides conclusions and potential future work.
